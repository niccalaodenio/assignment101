Hello World
whoever read this MD, hello. :)

I'll be honest with you, I just created this using HTML and SCSS/CSS, I'm gonna use css framework sana if they allow me. 
If you notice the design, I just redesign it from the www.bling.cloud cause I'm not really good at designing,
I am more into coding.
I am quit elated that I am part of their shortlisted for the first round of their technical interview. No matter what happen, I am grateful 
that Bling's given me a chance to become part of this round. THank you Bling! God Bless you all and More Power!
